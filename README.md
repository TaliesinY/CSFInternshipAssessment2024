For this Assessment, I used CoinCaps stock market API to gather live data about different stck markets. Due to lack of structure and time however, I resorted to using localStorage rather than a server-sided database.
To run the code, simply download the files and run the index.html file. Personally I used Visual Studio Code and the Live Share Extension for quick debugging and responsiveness.
