For this Assessment, I used CoinCaps stock market API to gather live data about different stck markets. Due to lack of structure and time however, I resorted to using localStorage rather than a server-sided database.
To run the code, simply download the files and run the index.html file. Personally I used Visual Studio Code and the Live Share Extension for quick debugging and responsiveness.
Use CoinCaps API documentation to determine searches, as searches not included in the API will not return any data.
